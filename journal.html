HTML is a sandwich form of code where each section is responbile for a different part of the code. Within each larger section of code there are multiple smaller sections and so on and so forth creating essentially folders within each other. It is similar to the terminal form of navigating.

I coded a project where a lot of squares just rotate and change colors when you hover. I just used a simple hover command after copy and pasting the div command a couple hundred times and changed the transition time in order to make the drawing-like affect.
