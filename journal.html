HTML is a sandwich form of code where each section is responbile for a different part of the code. Within each larger section of code there are multiple smaller sections and so on and so forth creating essentially folders within each other. It is similar to the terminal form of navigating.

I coded a project where a lot of squares just rotate and change colors when you hover. I just used a simple hover command after copy and pasting the div command a couple hundred times and changed the transition time in order to make the drawing-like affect.

Today I put the final touches on my webiste by creating my about me page and polishing up my journal page. I just copy and pasted the menu bar at the top of my screen so it is the same in all pages. I continued the theme of using animated pictures at the background. Starting now I am going to work on more projects instead of my webstie.

So it's been a while, but I have started working on Zeran's Card. The basic idea is just a div of a book with a hover command to flip it for 3 seconds before changing the background pic of the div to a card to zeran for his bday. After that I just need to set up an event listener to change the background pic to a different picture every click.

I am starting to work on my valentine's day card. I am making one for my mom to just show her some appreciation. My idea is just to have a card with a div, which has a gif as the background image so just a basic gif with hearts, ect. Then to put another div over it with some text.
